applications 09 but  thought who better than  minister to raise  child 09 amen 10 plus  thought the baby would be in good hands with  doctor 10 good hands 10 healing hands 10 reverend can  ask does the bible say anything about adoption 10 it says do it 10 and behold she did adopt unto them  baby 10 and it was good 10 wow yeah wow 10  was wondering you both have such serious jobs 10 would you have time to take care of  baby and your flock 10 oh no my flock my flock is good 10 yeah my flock pretty much takes care of themselves by this point 10 good flock flock flock flock 10 but being  doctor that must take up  lot of time 10 not for me it doesn  10 so how  everything going in here 10 we re great  think  may have asked all my questions 10 good do you have questions for erica 10 yeah actually so you read  file that you liked 11 and then you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us 11 yes our system ensures total anonymity 11 we re very proud of it you should be 11 you re really on top of stuff 11 well then if there  nothing else then the two of us should talk 11  actually 11  don  think we have to we don  11 yeah when  read about you two  was pretty sure  wanted you 11 but  just thought we should meet face to face 11  ve made my decision 11  choose them 11 god this is great 11 this is so great did you hear that 11 yeah  did 11 hey 11 thank you thank you so much 11 you are so going to heaven 11 we got some really great stuff yeah 11 yeah but   not sure about some of the bras  got 11 really do you want to try some of them on for me 12 okay 12 wait

yeeeah 09 hi we re buying the house next door and we were wondering if we could just take  look around 09 oh sure   showing it to someone else right now but please look around 09 thanks 09 it feels like we re cheating on our house 09 and if we re gonna cheat shouldn  it be with like  hot younger house that does stuff that our house won  do 09 ours is so much better 09 this living room is smaller the dining room looks like  cave what  hole 09 so what do you think 09 love it 10 well we already have one offer on it and  think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one 10 they could be our neighbors what are they like 10 oh the woman upstairs is very nice she and her husband have two kids he  on wall street and she 10 oh my god 10 sure 10 hey joey want come with me to 10 are you ok 10 yeah  just  just feel bad about firing estelle this is got to be killing her 10 no that wouldn  kill her ordinary embolism might 10  don  know she  got to be taking it hard  was like her only client except for this guy who eats paper 10 and   guessing he eats more money than he makes 10 look  know she  not  great agent but she did stick with me for ten years 11   gonna call her and hire her again 11 no no no don  call her you wait for her to call you 11 why because patience is the road to understanding 11 which is the key to  happy heart 11 you blow me away 11 all right so promise you re gonna wait for her to call you 11  promise and that means never having to give  reason 11 what  small world 11 and yet  never run into beyonc 11 you two know each other 11 oh we go way back before monica

toughie don  don  12 no actually we re buying the house next door 12 why 12  don  know why 12 ooh that decides it then 12  was on the fence but knowing that you two would be our neighbors 12 ah now we have to get it ellen we re going to talk numbers 12 this can not be happening 12 okay the realtor said another couple made an offer 12 maybe the janice  won  get it maybe the other couple will 12 the only way that that is going to happen is if the other couple are the hitlers 12 okay okay all right what if we got both houses huh we can turn this house into  guest house 12 that is  great idea and by the way  don  mean to sound distasteful but when did you start crapping money 12 okay you come up with an idea 12 alright alright we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house we can still get out 13 but we love our house 13 will we love it so much with her next door 13 and she  gonna be louder out here too 13 just the crickets and oh my god 13 okay but if we don  get this house she  still gonna show up wherever we go 13  mean at least if she  here it eliminates the element of surprise 13  mean never again will you have to hear the three words 13 that make your balls jump back up inside your body 13 well we have to do something we can  have her living next door 13 oh that does it too 13 who is it 13 it  me ron 13 look  um  now rachel turned you down 13 but  think there

barry got home from his first date with rachel you hired the same band  can  use the same speech thank you thank you very much anyway  wish you both  wonderful life together and rachel what no no in all seriousness not  lot of women would have the guts to be here and even fewer who  do it with their asses hanging out   like to add something to that what are you adding what are you adding most of you don  know me   rachel  boyfriend oh dear god ross and   just like to say that it did take  lot of courage for rachel to come here tonight and just for the record she did not run out on barry because she had syphilis   serious the reason she walked out on barry is simply that she didn  love him which incidentally worked out pretty well for me cheers see you in the parking lot no rach and once again she is out of here okay who had 9 45 you know what bar   not gonna leave  probably should but   not  promised myself   make it through at least one of your weddings tonight all  wanted was to make it through this evening with  little bit of grace and dignity well  guess we can all agree that  not gonna happen  guess there  nothing really left to say except   her name was lola   she was  showgirl   with yellow feath   feathers in her hair   and  dress cut down to there   she would   merengue merengue thank you honey   and do the chacha   and while she  like to be  star   tony always

gives   sorry  just thought here come the water works  called the company that sent her and they don  care  called 911 and they yelled at me this is an emergency thanks again for the party the guys from work had  blast one of them had never been to  bachelor party before another one had never been to  party before so that wedding ring man that is nice  might pick one of those babies up for myself where might one get one of those when my grandmother first came to this country that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her so you might say that the ring is irreplaceable it  been in my family for generations every bride who  worn it has lived  long and happy life so you might say it   magic ring yeah the stripper stole it my ring my wedding ring the stripper stole my wedding ring how could this happen it all started when you said joey you be my best man all right   going to call the cops  screwed up but you don  have to turn me in not on you on the stripper

what struck me most when reading jane eyre was how the book was so ahead of its time if you re talking about feminism  think you re right well feminism yes but also the robots since that video camera thing didn  work out  thought that  would give you just  little preview you re naked  know are you okay   fine  saw  psychiatrist at work today why on account of my rage which if  may say right now is out of control he gave me  pill for it  pill when the psychiatrist told me to take  leave of absence because  yelled at my boss  started to get worked up again so he offered me  tranquilizer and

you ruined everyone  fun isn  it time you went home go back to 3b 3b everyone calm down  have something that   like to say who here likes ross of course you don  like him he didn  give you any money he raised his own hand when  asked who likes ross and he  wearing two name tags  ll be honest when  first met ross  didn  like him at all once  got to know him  saw that he is really sweet and caring

are you doing don  do it will you marry me what  bad idea  can  not look at it why are you doing this  don  know but  know   not afraid to do this   doing this because   sorry do you think the best reason to get married is because you re sorry the best reason is pregnancy sorry is fourth behind being ready and actually wanting to get married will you be my wife  want you to take  minute and think about how ridiculous this sounds   kind of wishing everyone wasn  here now none of that came from me  never said  wanted to have babies and get married  was really confused then  talked to these guys who two divorces and joey she  right you know yeah but still cheap shot you know when  said that  want you to deal with relationship stuff all on your own you re not ready  didn  think  was oh my god what would you have done if  had said yes  would ve been happy because  would spend the rest of my life with the woman  love or you would have seen  chandlershaped hole in that door will you pass that knife no  will not you don  have to be mean about it you re right   sorry will you marry me  was going to ask you to marry me because  didn  say hello to you or ask them to move in with you but   not sure chandler how long is this going to go on  think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so  long time this is fun remember that we were on  break thing   sorry will you marry me that  not funny'}"

shows courage when  thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job  said no that shows integrity and  was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage now  know that  ve already said courage but you ve got to have courage and finally when  thought you were making sexual advances  said no and  was not litigious so there you go you got courage you got integrity you got courage again

joey  feel bad look ross you don  have to okay it  not your fault  suck what kind of an actor can  even say mmm noodle soup you know what maybe you didn  mess up your audition because you suck maybe you messed up because you care more about your godson what do you mean  think subconsciously you lost me  think on some level you sabotaged your own audition so ben would get the part your way sounds  lot better than mine it  not that    bad actor no it  just that  care so damn much about little ben that it was more important for me to see him succeed there you go thank you thank you so did he get

joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me my god it was  car backfire but he didn  know that yeah  didn  know that it could just as easily have been  bullet ever think about joining the force we could use  guy like you who jumps at loud noises wow  could have died tonight if the car that backfired had run over you   going before he starts rambling about his newfound respect for life  do have  newfound respect for life oh my god you want to get some dinner yeah sure you know what if  heard  shot right now   throw my body on you maybe we should walk in  bad neighborhood okay bye cut it out   hate to save your life and kick your ass on the same day why  you take off just going for  walk around the living room whatever is something wrong no no   just tired you know from the walk you dove in front of ross ross that  what this is about oh my god you hate ross  don  hate ross of course you do  saved him you re mad at me it adds up you want ross out of the picture what picture  don  know but  don  like what   hearing   glad you saved ross but it could ve been  bullet and you didn  try to save me you re upset because you think  chose ross over you no  knew you could take care of yourself you know  mean ross needs help he  not street like us you  risk your life for ross before you would for me that  the bottom line no not exactly all right look  wasn  trying to save ross okay my sandwich was next to ross all right  was trying to save my sandwich from  bullet  know it doesn  make much sense much sense look it was instinct  just went for it you risked your life for  sandwich  know it sounds crazy but this is the greatest sandwich in the world so you didn  choose ross before me no  would never do that you re like my brother really yeah in fact to prove how much you mean to me here thanks easy it  not  hot dog how good is that see what are you doing you re showing me how much  mean to you with  bite jeez what are you doing here hey you know what you are in our apartment all the time this is just  drop in the bucket mister it doesn  matter the important thing is that you re here you re my friend and you re here okay just  little scared what  going on the most amazing thing happened tonight  thought my number was up  had an actual neardeath experience what happened we were on the ridealong with gary and somebody took  shot at me really no  car backfired but  thought somebody was taking  shot at me and rach  survived and  was filled with this great respect for life  want to experience every moment  want to seize every opportunity  am seeing everything so clearly now because  car backfired okay why are you here  don  know how this fits into your whole seizing thing but emily called you today you talked to her she left  message but it kind of got erased  mean there  something wrong with your machine what did she say something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make  mistake breaking up and she wants you to call her wow that was  good thing that  told you right yeah yes of course okay thank you thank you because   gonna tell monica  was right because she didn  want not important point is  was right your decision okay  was right your decision right  guess  should call emily no that  not the right decision that  not right ross come on  mean that woman made you miserable do you really want to get back into that okay look yesterday  wouldn  have even considered calling her back but my exwife calls on the same day  have  neardeath experience that  gotta mean something that was not  neardeath experience that was barely an experience you weren  there maybe this is something that   supposed to seize you know okay you know what maybe this is not about seizing stuff maybe this is about escaping stuff okay look at today  mean you escaped death and maybe this is  chance for you to escape getting back together with emily that does make sense because  do want to seize some opportunity but  really don  want to see or talk to her well there you go yeah maybe today  just closecall day hey thanks rach oh honey no problem wait wait the message is blinking maybe you didn  erase it   hey ross it  you that  an old message nobody needs to hear that hey was monica here  want my money back you probably need that for stamps right has gary ever been shot at for real yes once  little he kind of did it to himself it  not really  good story  wonder how   react under fire and not backfire but heavy fire like if  was in  war man  would be great in  war  think   make  fantastic military leader  mean  know   make general before any of you guys before or after you were shot by your own troops  know joey would be in the foxhole protecting all of us if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches yeah

alone together 12 oh my god that  funny  can  believe  did that 12 no sweetie you know what this is my fault 12  wasn  clear 12   really sorry 12 listen you take as much time as you need to move out

be able to have those long talks at night 13 about our feelings and the future 13 not once did we do that 13  told rachel that it  just gonna be the two of us 13 oh yeah well how  she take it 13 really well 13 surprisingly well 13 she didn  cry she wasn  angry or sad 13 and you re upset because you didn  make your best friend cry 13 all   asking for is  little emotion 13 is that too much to ask after six years 13 what are rachel and  not as close as you guys 13  mean did we not have as much fun don   deserve  few tears 14 when we told joey he cried his eyes out 14  did not cry my eyes out 14 come on it  like the end of an era 14 no more jman and channy  14 okay  gotta ask who calls us that 14 you got married again 14 yes 14 so that  your second marriage in two years 14 yes second in two years 14 third overall 14  have been  divorce attorney for 23 years 14 and never have  had so much business from one client 14 why don  you tell me what happened 14 basically rachel and  were in vegas and we got drunk 14   sorry is this the same rachel whose name you said 14 at the altar in the second marriage 15 yes yes yes 15 but  do not love her 15 that  better then 15 this was just  drunken mistake and  need to get it annulled 15  see 15 have you considered therapy 15  think just the annulment for today 15 there are some forms to fill out easy 15 we ll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind 15 no problem 15 we ll need you and rachel to testify before  judge 15 there  no way to do this without her 15 because  kind of already told her it was taken care of 15 of course you did 15 look you can  get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there 15 what about someone who looks like rachel 15  will think about the therapy 16 so  was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff 16 okay 16 no point in dragging it out 16 dragging out the long process of you moving out 16 and us not living together anymore 16 what about this who gets this 16  don  know if  want it because it might be too many memories 16 what is that  don  know 16 how about this  want you to have the big plate 16 wow monica thanks  love this plate 16 something to remember me by 16 mon you re not dying   just moving out 16 we re gonna see each other all the time 16 but still it   big change 17 the end of an era you might say 17 are you okay you re not blinking 17   fine  was thinking about how it  an end of an era 17 oh all right 17 but  gotta say  don  think six years counts as an era 17 an era is defined as  significant period of time 17 it was significant for me maybe it wasn  significant to you 17 what is the matter with you what is the matter with you 17 why aren  you more upset 17 aren  you gonna be sad that we re not living together 17 aren  you gonna miss me at all 17 monica all right but don  get mad at me 17 it  just  little hard to believe 17 what  hard to believe 17  mean it  you guys you do this kind of stuff you know 17

and now it  lodged in my throat 09 this whole time we were concentrating on the babies 09 and no one was watching chandler 10 you are asking the court for an annulment 10 yes your honor here are our forms all filled out 10 so based on your petition 10 you are seeking an annulment on the grounds 10 that mr geller is mentally unstable 10 fine   mentally unstable 10 and based on the fact that mr geller is an intravenous drug user 10 what yes heroin and crack 10 crack isn  even an intravenous drug 10 well you would know 10 now it also says here that you 10 iied about your sexual preference before marriage 10 oh come on 10 ross please  found the magazines 10 and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage 10 well that makes sense since you re gay and addicted to heroin 10 you know   sorry this is insane 10   not addicted to heroin   not gay and there is no problem 11 with my ability to consummate anything 11  ll consummate this marriage right here right now 11 that won  be necessary 11 and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies 11 if you were involved in  serious relationship that creates  problem 11 rest assured that relationship ended two years ago 11 strike consummated like bunnies from the record 11 is there anything in this record that is actually true 11 well yes we got married in vegas 11 and the names  think 11 based on what  ve heard you certainly don  qualify for an annulment 11 if you don  wanna be together file for divorce 11 that  great you happy look what you did with your funny funny form 11 what me what about you and your consummated

phoebe  just wanted to say   sorry okay 13  handled the situation horribly 13 and  should not have lied to you 13 so what should you have done 13  should have told you the truth 13 which is 13 well the reason  didn  want to go running with you is 13 because 13 the way that you run is just  little 13 so it  embarrassing 13 people were looking at us like we were crazy 13 why do you care because they re people 13 people you don  know and will never see again 13 yes but still they are people 13 with eyes 13  didn  get embarrassed running next to miss 13 but okay 13  can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you 13 okay you re uptight 14 what  am not uptight 14  am not uptight man 14 that  okay   not judging you that  just who you are 14   more free you know  run like  did when

hell am  gonna tell him maybe you don  have to tell him  like that yeah if you clear things up with rachel ross never needs to find out but you have to do it before he hears about it and kicks your ass all right let  not get carried away  want  baby honey we ve been over this  need to be facing the other way if we have sex again it ll double our chances of getting pregnant  think that closet  still available  am so tired yeah okay but no foreplay deal dad seriously you know you really should see someone about that noted  wanna go talk to rachel for  minute are you gonna be okay alone for  bit are you kidding me  could stay and look at her forever actually hey hi are you all right  think  just got engaged oh my god he did it what did you know he was gonna ask me are you kidding   like

 want to say anything in front of joey  didn  know if he knew what that we had  baby now let  give him  little credit although he did eat  piece of plastic fruit earlier no no that you and rachel are engaged what oh it   secret goody yes we haven  done the secret thing in  long time phoebe there is no secret okay  didn  propose are you lying is this like that time you tried to convince us you were  doctor  am  doctor you know what   just gonna go and talk to rachel myself all right well me too well should we wake her up no no come on let her sleep she  so exhausted and so engaged oh my god she thinks we re engaged why why why would she think we re engaged perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring you know ross doctors are supposed to be smart  didn  give her that ring you didn  no so whose ring is it it  mine is it an engagement ring yes but you didn  give it to her no but you were going to propose no  might be losing interest in this look look my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel but all  wanted to do was see if she maybe kind of wanted to start things up again what beautiful lukewarm sentiment  didn  want to rush into anything it seemed like she didn  want to either but  don  understand how any of this happened what did she find the ring in my jacket assume  was gonna propose throw it on and just start telling people no no she said you actually proposed to her well  didn   didn  propose unless did   haven  slept in 40 hours and it does sound like something  would do look we can  stay in here forever it  just  still can  believe that my dad saw us having sex he didn  make it to one of my piano recitals but this he sees this is okay we re all adults here there  nothing to be ashamed of now let  put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door hi dad  can still call you that right of course  ll always be your dad  just want you to know that what you witnessed in there that wasn  for fun it wasn  fun why why why would you

gets worse because  told him  would see him tomorrow night phoebe  know evil  like mike so much you know it  just going really well oh my god isn  it ironic that david would show up on the same day that you and mike exchange keys yeah you know and given my lifelong search for irony you can imagine how happy  am what are you gonna do  mean  guess  just have to tell david that nothing can happen between us unless  don  you know complicated moral situation no right no wrong you have to tell david  knew  should ve had this conversation with joey funniest guy she  ever met   funny right what do

way the people from tulsa talk okay what  with the word  all you know just two words just pushed together are we all allowed to do that because if so  say why stop there you know your new poodle could be your noodle and fried chicken could be fricken waiter waiter excuse me  ll have the fricken see that  funny with the fricken right no it just reminds me of something this guy did today at work  told you about that funny guy jeffrey right yeah he came up well he did this bit you probably had to be there but it was liza minnelli locked in our freezer eating  raw chicken were you there no but it sounds fricken funny  really understand how hard it  gotta be to leave your child with another person  mean it  like leaving behind  piece of your heart sandy that  exactly what it is are you gay it  okay  get that  lot doing what  do but  am straight   engaged actually her name  delia that  pretty so you re just like  guy who   nanny  realize how it   bit unorthodox for some people but  really believe the most satisfying thing you can do with your life is take care of  child okay like at my last job  met daniel when he was 3 weeks old and  got to watch him grow into this awesome person when  left  said  ll see you soon and he said to me skadandy that was his name for me  ll see you every day right in it  okay yeah kids say all kinds of crap oh god she must need her diaper

could see  tape like that and not be bothered it  just be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men  club over brandy and mustaches is all of this about you not being able to grow  mustache this is about you and richard he  clearly not over you he keeps  tape so he can look at it whenever he wants isn  that sad can  you see how pathetic that is don  be jealous you should feel bad for him

makeup on you happy thanksgiving hey hi so welcome is this the first time you re seeing emma yeah  think so it  nice to meet you emma phoebe that   funny noise pheebs  still need some help here right okay so it  not just the lie you tell but it  the way you tell it for example if you look at the ground when you talk people know you re lying  don  know why this is so hard for me lying is basically just acting and  am  terrific actor you are  terrific actor hey where  the baby we just put her down for  nap listen  was just thinking you know what would be incredible if you guys died thank you amy no no then  would get the baby it would be just like  movie at first  wouldn  know what to do with her and then  would rise to the occasion then   get  makeover and get married that   great movie yeah listen not that you guys could stop me or anything because you know you  be dead but  was thinking about changing her name   just not really  big fan of emily emma emma ross wants you phoebe why does she keep making that noise honey  don  know how to tell you this but if something were to happen to ross or myself you wouldn  get the baby well who would well we haven  officially asked them yet but we would want monica and chandler  can  believe you  want us to raise emma oh my god   so moved  don  believe this hold on  second you guys die and  don  get your baby amy see we re  lot closer to monica and chandler we see them every day and truthfully you don  seem connected to the baby connected to what she   lump you know guys  ve gotta say this means so much to me  mean that you would trust me with your child  mean we all know that monica and  have been trying to have  baby of our own you know  ve had my doubts about my skills as  father but that you two that you two this guy seriously okay it  time for dinner everyone we re using our fancy china and it  very expensive so please be careful okay just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be wellreceived hey how come my plate  less fancy than everyone else  do you not trust me with  fancy plate no honey that   special plate see it   game whoever gets that plate wins  can  believe  won you know this is such  slap in the face  mean   your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me monica is ross sister no ross sister was really fat that was me no she was this dorky girl in school who followed rachel around like  puppy amy you ve got to stop doing that okay listen  know you re having  bit of  family crisis but you don  have to take it out on the plates  mean in fact  think that everyone should cut their food like this now see this way you protect the plates and let  face it you have fun okay how about this if you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies then do  get the baby no if crazy plate lady if monica dies then  would get emma right well actually actually what it  just it  just that in that case then emma would go to my parents what hurts doesn  it who has to die for me to get her so if monica  not around   not good enough to raise emma no that is not what we re saying yeah he  lying he looked down well what  wrong with me am  incompetent because  managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you you re taking this the wrong way we think you ll be  wonderful parent it  just you re more the you know fun parent yeah and we wanna make sure emma also has someone like monica who  more of  disciplinarian someone who can be firm and strict that  not how you see me is it no you re all about the fun  may not know  lot about babies but do you really think   not capable no you both are equally capable it  just you re strongest when you re together okay so if we both had emma and  died she  have to give her up sure monica would have to give her up  lie better than that right let me just get this straight so my two friends die  get emma then my wife dies then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me there  your movie hey there you are you disappeared after dinner did somebody miss me was there  child to raise poorly ross and rachel don  know what they re saying it  not like they re so responsible emma is  product of  bottle of merlot and  fiveyearold condom no but they re right   not  strong father figure and  never will be no you learn these things you grow into it yeah but it  not who  am everything they said is exactly why  was worried about having  kid and it  true and look everybody knows it  don  know it  wanna have  kid with you because  think you ll be an amazing dad at the fun

not  couple yet you have  baby isn  that weird and  say no it  not because it works for us but you know what this doesn  work in fact this is the opposite of working clearly and you know we said that

seriously well   not proud of it but you know when  was living on the street and  needed money for food and stuff that is awful  wasn  rich like you guys okay  didn  eat gold and have  flying pony  had  hard life my mother was killed by  drug dealer your mother killed herself she was  drug dealer it was  good thing she knew him  was about to do some serious damage okay this must have brought back some bad memories for you ross why ross was mugged as  kid you were yeah and it was pretty traumatic it was outside st mark  comics  was minding my business seeing what kind of trouble spiderman was into wonder woman anyway  was heading towards this bakery to pick up  couple of dozen linzer tortes for someone when out of nowhere this thug with  pipe jumps out and says give me your money punk oh my god  know and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork  did for my own comic book science boy oh yeah what was his super power again  superhuman thirst for knowledge  better get to class are there any more of your friends  should look out for no actually you might want to stay away from jane street that  where stabby joe works  think we have  problem here what back in my mugging days  worked st mark  comics yeah  pipe was my weapon of choice and preteen comicbook nerds were my meat so there was one kid who had  sticker on his backpack that said geology rocks geology rocks oh my god  know  mugged ross you re late  know   sorry but can  just run to the bathroom no leonard doesn  wait but  am bursting with yoohoo joey here we go let  go very

because  really gotta go look at that still in character  like him  plant seeds  can  explain it  don  know hey what are you doing putting on the sneakers to get in the young mindset see if it sparks anything oh anything yet yes how  this they re so uncomfortable it  like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet you re probably wondering what   doing no that seems about right yesterday at my audition  had to pee apparently that makes me  good actor  got  callback so   drinking everything oh by the way that eggnog in our fridge was great joey that was formula we gotta get more of that

confession to make okay you know that girl that mugged you when you were  kid what are you talking about it wasn   girl it was this huge dude you don  have to lie anymore  know that it was  14yearold

thing happened at work the my songs aren  good enough for your restaurant okay we re still on that  didn  say they weren  good enough then what  wrong with them what they don  go with your tiny portions of pretentious food tiny portions yeah well excuse me  ordered the smoked salmon appetizer but  can  see it  can  see it phoebe it  not about quantity well it  not about quality oh really you wanna talk about quality have you ever heard of  key it  what some people sing in well at least all my songs don  taste like garlic yeah there are other ingredients monica so that  what we re doing when   in  coffeehouse bopping along to one of your songs   wearing earplugs earplugs or cloves of garlic you know what  take back what  said before keep playing at the restaurant because with your

your garlic peelers off me excuse me excuse me hi   monica geller   the head chef here okay  was actually expecting  little applause there but whatever quick question by  show of hands how many of you were bothered by this woman  singing outside okay okay how many of you enjoyed the music outside let me ask you this question how many thought the music was fine but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant who identified this restaurant  tone as pretentiouscommagarlicky okay who thinks the food is delicious and  little pretension never hurt anyone okay well all right who thinks the food is fine the music was fine but your evening was ruined by this incessant polltaking excuse us all right here   question who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made  big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now well who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend  cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great   sorry   sorry too hey you wanna stick around and  ll whip you up some dinner yeah as long as it  free the food here is ridiculously overpr who hopes the handraising thing is still cute enough that you won  hate me joey do you have peanut butter on the back of your head oh man  thought  got it all how how  was making  peanut butter smoothie right  couldn  find this little plastic thingy that goes in the top of the blender and  thought well you know how important can that be right turns out very wow definitely just drake what how  it going with drake  don  think it  going very well what that scene

to make it convincing that   in love with olivia so so  ve never played that oh honey it can  be that hard  mean you ve been in love before well just once with you okay well this could be  little awkward   just gonna blow past it well look can  you just use that methodactor thing where you use your reallife memories to help you in your performance what the hell are you talking about all right look just try to remember how you felt when you were in love and think about that when you re playing the scene okay yeah  think  can do that yeah okay there  this party scene coming up and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her but he can  that makes me think about those times  wanted to grab you and kiss you but you didn  know so  would just pretend everything was cool but really it was killing me joey you never talked about that before hey you know what else  could use there  this scene where drake sneaks into olivia  bedroom and she doesn  know he  there which never happened with us  mean he knows he shouldn  be there but he just wants to look at her you know and  remember all those mornings before you even put on your makeup when  would think to myself my god she is beautiful and it hurt so much because  knew  could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you thanks dude this is great  got you something from

can  believe my sperm have low motility while  was growing up they sure seemed to be in  hurry to get places hi there hi   sorry there wasn  better news from your tests last week but  wanted to talk to you about your options okay even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren  great you never know so keep having sex on  regular basis oh damn it don  worry after  while you ll tune it out given your situation the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy or insemination using  sperm donor if you feel that neither of those is right for you you could always adopt is that  hint because we love you dr connelly but we don  want you to be our child wow talk about an inhospitable environment hi okay you ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping let  do it all right have  good time not gonna find any clothes in there hey you guys hi guess who  up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference chris bailey yeah right when was the last

you guys bye see you so how did it go at the fertility clinic not as much fun as last time apparently you only get porn if you re giving  sperm sample so what did the doctor say there  surrogacy but monica  dreamt her whole life of carrying  child and she just felt that watching  surrogate would be too hard for her so you re ruling out surrogacy yeah so  don  have to learn what that means aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination so we re talking about sperm donors enough said   there for you man where is she upstairs how do you feel about all this  wish there was an easier way for us to have  child but there isn  one come on ross be  good guy step up and do it what what no   not gonna give them ben the data we re receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are staggering  mean we ve been accepting leakey  dates as  given but if they re off by even  years or so then you can just throw most of our assumptions you know right in the trash 9965 so what   saying is is that is that repercussions could be huge  mean not just in paleontology but if you think about it in evolutionary biology genetics geology  mean truly the mind boggles well that  not what
