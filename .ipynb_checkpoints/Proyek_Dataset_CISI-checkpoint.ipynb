The first edition of the DDC was published in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's long and healthy life, however, its full story has never been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey that briefly describe his system, but this is the first attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that more than any other has spurred the growth of librarianship in this country and abroad.\n",

      "Two Kinds of Power An Essay on Bibliographic Control Wilson, P. The relationships between the organization and control of writings and the organization and control of knowledge and information will inevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, a great deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information.  Bibliographical control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power, as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written form.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings. \n"
